## Hi there 😁

I'm **Ibraheem** 

Right now, I’m diving into machine learning and game development, chasing the idea of worlds that don’t just look alive, but *think*.

Most of my time is spent on VS Code and godot, but i balance screen time with books and anime marathons.

Lately, i've been fascinated with how machines learn and understand the human world.

⚡ Fun fact:
  - I love experimenting with ways AI can shape gameplay, not just graphics.
  - Half my “ideas” come from random anime scenes… the other half while waiting for code to compile.
